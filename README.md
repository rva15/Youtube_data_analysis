# YouTube Trending Videos Dataset
Visualization and analysis of the open trending videos dataset using pandas and matplotlib

## Motivation
To discover the top videos by features such as views, likes, dislikes. Finding out the most successful youtube channels. Also searching for patterns within the dataset such as the correlation between views and likes, time for which a video trends and time it takes for it to start trending. 

## Installation
The entire dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle website : 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new/data'.
It is divided into 5 csv files by region (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada and France) with up to 200 listed trending videos per day. Download the files into the same directory that you will clone this notebook in, and run.
